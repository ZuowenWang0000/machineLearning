\paragraph{}
Due to the rapid development of social network these years, short to medium length texts are gradually dominating the Internet. Various user backgrounds on large social networks such as Twitter and Facebook result in difficulties recommending users the content they would like to view. One way to satisfy this demand is to extract ‘class’ from texts, namely text classification. Then based on the summarized topic information, we can do further meaningful operations accordingly.
%   c) what are the previous solutions by others?
\paragraph{}
Numerous works have already been conducted in the past years. From the most recent application of neural networks in the field of natural language processing like ...  to more classical models including ...

%   d) what you did to solve this problem?
\paragraph{}
We first roughly tested different methods which where commonly used for classical short text classification tasks. Then we focused on feature engineering because we want to exploit the very limited information from limited information of short paragraphs. We also write a script to craw down new twitter posts, which are typically in short text format, to evaluate the performance
